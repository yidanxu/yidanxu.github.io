COMP 20: Web Programming
Assignment 1


A beginning portolio website that contains a homepage, a resume,
and a brief biography. My tufts cs homepage redirects to github.
Not counting the reading and research I believe this project took
around 20 hours, most of that trial and error to figure out what 
elements I needed in my css file and how to change it around to
make it look better. I have no collaborated with anyone nor have
I discussed the assignment with anyone, though the class notes 
and html and css cheatsheets proved invaluable.
